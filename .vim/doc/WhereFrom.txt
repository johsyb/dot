2. WhereFrom Manual			*wherefrom-man* *whereform-manual*

	WhereFrom[!] functionname(s)      WF[!] functionname(s)
	WhereFrom[!] map(s)               WF[!] map(s)
	WhereFrom[!] setting(s)           WF[!] setting(s)
	WhereFrom[!] command(s)           WF[!] command(s)
	
	The WhereFrom and WF commands search the runtimepath (see
	|'runtimepath'|) to determine where the setting, function, map, or
	command was defined.  With the "!", WhereFrom will continue looking
	for more than one instance.
	
	WF-style commands are available only if the command has not been
	previously defined, and are provided as a shorthand.

	A search is undertaken only for functions, commands, and maps, and
	then only if the function, command, or map is known to the currently
	running vim.  Determining where settings are set is done using vim's
	built-in method.

	These commands don't search all *.vim files that you may have; it only
	examines those that lie on your runtimepath in the common directories
	plugin, ftplugin, colors, compilier, indent, syntax, and the after/
	variants.  In addition, it also searches the AsNeeded directory
	(see http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=915)
